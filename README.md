#### Hi there.
I'm a Math & CS student at the [Department of Mathematics and Computer Science](http://math-cs.spbu.ru/) of [St. Petersburg State University](http://www.spbu.ru/).

My general interests are theoretical computer science (especially automata theory, cryptography) and programming. My favourites are Python, Android, and C++.

Currently I'm working on an article "*On the complexity of transformation of reversible two-way finite automata to one-way deterministic finite automata*" under [Alexander Okhotin](https://users.math-cs.spbu.ru/~okhotin/) supervising.
